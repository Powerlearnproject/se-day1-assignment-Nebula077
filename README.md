# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
It is important because;
It has enabled creation of software applications and systems that enable communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare systems to function properly.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of digital computers
development of programming languages
Rise of artificial intelligence

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements; Gathering data, documenting user needs and system requirements
Design; Creating high-level and detailed designs
Implementation; writing code and building the software accodingly
Testing; Conduction accessibility and functionality tests
Deployment; Releasing to users
Maintenance; Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is mainly sequential and follows distinct steps  and can be used when conducting reserach while agile methodologies are flexible to shifting demands and can be applied when developing social media applications.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes the code and implements software solutions
Quality assurance Engineer ensures the quality of the software system
Project manager oversees all the stages from planning, execution and delivery of software systems

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated software developments (IDEs) have enhanced productivity by enablinng easier writing debugging and testing of code. They include VirtualStudio code and IntelliJ
Version control systems have enabled coordination of work among team members. They iclude github and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines; Prioritizing tasks
Changing requirements; Effective communication
Technical debt; Agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components of a software to ensure proper functionality
Intergration testing is testing interaction between different components to ensure interactivity
System testing is testing thee whole system to ensure proper functionality
Acceptance testing is testing against customer requirements to ensure customer acceptance

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the writing of detailed instructions to ensure high quality response from Ai models.
Importance;
High quality answers
Correct response


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague; How is cake baked
Improved; Provide clear steps on how to bake cakes for 3 people
